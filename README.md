Car Price Prediction Flask App
A Flask-based web application that predicts the selling price of a used car based on various input features like year, fuel type, kilometers driven, seller type, transmission type, etc.
A Random Forest Regression model powers the prediction.

 Problem Statement
Many people struggle to estimate a fair selling price for their used cars. Incorrect pricing can lead to financial loss or difficulty selling the car.

 Solution
We have built a Machine Learning-powered web application that allows users to:

Input key car details.

Instantly receive a predicted selling price.

This helps users make informed decisions based on data rather than guesswork.
